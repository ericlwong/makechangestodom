        <h1>Manipulating the DOM</h1>

        <p>After completing the required reading for Week 5, I have decided to implement the topic of DOM manipulation on this webpage.
            To do so, we are going to create a To-Do list. This will showcase DOM manipulation by <b>inserting Nodes</b> into the DOM.</p>

        <div class="todo">
            <h2>Insert Items into To-Do List Showcase</h2>
            <input type="text" id="item" placeholder="Type here">
            <button type="button" onclick="insertItem()">Insert Item</button>
            <h3>To-Do List</h3>
            <ul></ul>       <!--Empty unordered list to be manipulated-->
        </div>

        <p>Above, you are able to manipulate the DOM by inserting new Nodes into it. You start with an empty to do list which you can
            then populate with any number of tasks. The list will continue to get bigger and bigger as long as you insert new tasks.</p>
